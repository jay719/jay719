### 🐐 What's up, I'm Javaria! 🐐

Full stack developer and native of Colorado Springs. Passion for learning new tech to build upon my roots in Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I love intergrating my customer experience background with my code to create user-friendly applications. 


When taking a break from the city/mountain life, I enjoy collaborating on projects and problem solving with others.
